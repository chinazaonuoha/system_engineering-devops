 #script that provides information about a file named school. Your script should perform the following checks and print the corresponding messages:

# Check if 'school' exists (any type)
if [ -e school ]; then
  # Check if it's a regular file
    if [ -f school ]; then
        echo "school is a regular file"
	  fi
	    # If it exists but is NOT a regular file (e.g., a directory or symlink), do nothing
	    fi

# Check if 'school' is a regular file
if [ -f school ]; then
  echo "school is a regular file"

  # Check if 'school' is empty
    if [ ! -s school ]; then
        echo "school exists but is empty"
	  else
	      echo "school is not empty"
	        fi
